        <h1>Food and Travel Reader Awards</h1>
        <h2>Food and Travel Reader Awards 2020</h2>



        <p>Nine years ago we set out to create a unique series of awards. We wanted
            to impartially identify the very best in the business, judged by experts
            who could draw on real-life experiences to inform their vote. These
            experts had to be people with unrivalled knowledge and passion for
            travel and food. They had to be people like you. Unlike other industry
            awards, ours are entirely nominated and voted on by <em>Food and
                Travel</em> magazine readers.</p>
        <p>Voting for the 2020 Food and Travel Reader Awards is now open. Pick your
            favourites from the shortlist below and crown your winners. You must be
            registered and logged in to vote in the 2020 awards.<br /></p>
