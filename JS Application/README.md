# JavaScript Applications

### Course Description

The course ["JavaScript Applications"](https://softuni.bg/trainings/3488/js-applications-october-2021) includes topics such as **HTTP requests**, **REST Services**,  **Baas** (backend as a service), **asynchronous code** (Promises, using async / await), **Templating and Routing**. During the course you create a Single Page Application, using the learned techniques from previous lectures. You learn what the architecture of an application is and how to properly structure your applications. Towards the end of the course you look at different design templates and their practical direction, you create your own web components using the Web Components standard and you raise a Wepback environment from scratch.
